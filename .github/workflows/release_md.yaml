# Workflow for building the release binaries.
#
# This workflow runs as a post-submit step, when pushing to main or the release
# branches (v*.*.x), and when creating a release in GitHub.
#
# In the GitHub release case, in addition to build the release binaries it also
# uploads the binaries to the given release automatically.
