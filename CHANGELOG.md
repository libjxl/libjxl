## Unreleased

### Added
 - encoder API: add `JxlEncoderSetExtraChannelDistance` to adjust the quality
   of extra channels (like alpha) separately.

### Removed

### Changed

   preference for getting an associated alpha channel with premultiplied or
   unpremultiplied colors.
 - decoder API: field added to `JxlFrameHeader`: a `JxlLayerInfo` struct
   that contains crop dimensions and offsets and blending information for
   the non-coalesced case.
 - decoder API: new function `JxlDecoderGetExtraChannelBlendInfo` to get
   the blending information for extra channels in the non-coalesced case.
 - decoder API: new function `JxlDecoderSetMultithreadedImageOutCallback`,

   frames using `JxlEncoderSetFrameName`, `JxlEncoderFrameSettingsSetOption`,
   `JxlEncoderFrameSettingsSetFloatOption`.
 - encoder API: added ability to check required codestream compatibility level
   and force specified using `JxlEncoderGetRequiredCodestreamLevel` and
   `JxlEncoderSetCodestreamLevel`.
 - encoder API: added ability to force emitting box-based container format
   using `JxlEncoderUseContainer`.

### Changed
- decoder API: using `JxlDecoderCloseInput` at the end of all input is required
  when using JXL_DEC_BOX, and is now also encouraged in other cases, but not
  required in those other cases for backwards compatibility.
- encoder API: `JxlEncoderCloseInput` now closes both frames and boxes input.
- CLI: `cjxl` and `djxl` have been reimplemented on the base of public decoder
  and encoder API; dropped dependency on `gflags` for argument parsing.

### Deprecated
- decoder API: `JXL_DEC_EXTENSIONS` event: use `JXL_DEC_BASIC_INFO`
- decoder / encoder API: pixel types `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` and `JXL_TYPE_UINT32`:
  consider using `JXL_TYPE_UINT8` and `JXL_TYPE_FLOAT` correspondingly.

  instead.
- encoder API: deprecated `JXL_ENC_NOT_SUPPORTED`, the encoder returns
  `JXL_ENC_ERROR` instead and there is no need to handle
  `JXL_ENC_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-10-29
### Changed
 - Security: Fix OOB read in splines rendering (#735 -
   [CVE-2021-22563](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22563))
 - Security: Fix OOB copy (read/write) in out-of-order/multi-threaded decoding
   (#708 - [CVE-2021-22564](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22564))
 - Fix segfault in `djxl` tool with `--allow_partial_files` flag (#781).
 - Fix border in extra channels when using upsampling (#796)

## [0.6] - 2021-10-04
### Added
 - API: New functions to decode extra channels:
   `JxlDecoderExtraChannelBufferSize` and `JxlDecoderSetExtraChannelBuffer`.
 - API: New function `JxlEncoderInitBasicInfo` to initialize `JxlBasicInfo`
   (only needed when encoding). NOTE: it is now required to call this function
   when using the encoder. Padding was added to the struct for forward
   compatibility.
 - API: Support for encoding oriented images.
 - API: FLOAT16 support in the encoder API.
 - Rewrite of the GDK pixbuf loader plugin. Added proper color management and
   animation support.
 - Rewrite of GIMP plugin. Added compression parameters dialog and switched to
   using the public C API.
 - Debian packages for GDK pixbuf loader (`libjxl-gdk-pixbuf`) and GIMP
   (`libjxl-gimp-plugin`) plugins.
 - `cjxl`/`djxl` support for `stdin` and `stdout`.

### Changed
 - API: Renamed the field `alpha_associated` in `JxlExtraChannelInfo` to
   `alpha_premultiplied`, to match the corresponding name in `JxlBasicInfo`.
 - Improved the 2x2 downscaling method in the encoder for the optional color
   channel resampling for low bit rates.
 - Fixed: the combination of floating point original data, XYB color encoding,
   and Modular mode was broken (in both encoder and decoder). It now works.
   NOTE: this can cause the current encoder to write jxl bitstreams that do
   not decode with the old decoder. In particular this will happen when using
   cjxl with PFM, EXR, or floating point PSD input, and a combination of XYB
   and modular mode is used (which caused an encoder error before), e.g.
   using options like `-m -q 80` (lossy modular), `-d 4.5` or `--progressive_dc=1`
   (modular DC frame), or default lossy encoding on an image where patches
   end up being used. There is no problem when using cjxl with PNG, JPEG, GIF,
   APNG, PPM, PGM, PGX, or integer (8-bit or 16-bit) PSD input.
 - `libjxl` static library now bundles skcms, fixing static linking in
   downstream projects when skcms is used.
 - Spline rendering performance improvements.
 - Butteraugli changes for less visual masking.

## [0.5] - 2021-08-02
### Added
 - API: New function to decode the image using a callback outputting a part of a
   row per call.
 - API: 16-bit float output support.
 - API: `JxlDecoderRewind` and `JxlDecoderSkipFrames` functions to skip more
   efficiently to earlier animation frames.
 - API: `JxlDecoderSetPreferredColorProfile` function to choose color profile in
   certain circumstances.
 - encoder: Adding `center_x` and `center_y` flags for more control of the tile
   order.
 - New encoder speeds `lightning` (1) and `thunder` (2).

### Changed
 - Re-licensed the project under a BSD 3-Clause license. See the
   [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [PATENTS](PATENTS) files for details.
 - Full JPEG XL part 1 specification support: Implemented all the spec required
   to decode files to pixels, including cases that are not used by the encoder
   yet. Part 2 of the spec (container format) is final but not fully implemented
   here.
 - Butteraugli metric improvements. Exact numbers are different from previous
   versions.
 - Memory reductions during decoding.
 - Reduce the size of the jxl_dec library by removing dependencies.
 - A few encoding speedups.
 - Clarify the security policy.
 - Significant encoding improvements (~5 %) and less ringing.
 - Butteraugli metric to have some less masking.
 - `cjxl` flag `--speed` is deprecated and replaced by the `--effort` synonym.

### Removed
- API for returning a downsampled DC was deprecated
  (`JxlDecoderDCOutBufferSize` and `JxlDecoderSetDCOutBuffer`) and will be
  removed in the next release.

   to the codestream format are still possible but we are not expecting any
   changes beyond what is required by bug fixing.
 - API: new decoder API in C, check the `examples/` directory for its example
   usage. The C API is a work in progress and likely to change both in API and
   ABI in future releases.
